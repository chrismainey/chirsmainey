About me
================

I am a senior Data Scientist in the UK National Health Service (NHS). I
lead an analytical team at North Central London ICB. I have experience 
in patient safety, public health, statistical and machine learning models,
clinical networks and acute trust informatics. I have led the Patient
Safety Measure team at NHS England and the establishment
of a data science team at Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED), a national
NHS analytics service from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS
Foundation Trust.

I completed my PhD in applied statistics and machine learning at UCL in
2020, focussing on methods for analysing incident reporting data in the
NHS using multi-level models, Generalized Additive Models, tree and
random forest methods and natural language processing (NLP). I also have
a strong interest in training and teaching. I'm a senior fellow of 
the NHS-R community and member of their technical advisory group.

I’m particularly into `R`, but skilled in SQL and several other
languages. Skilling up in Python at the moment.

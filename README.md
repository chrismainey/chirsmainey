About me
================

I am a senior Data Scientist in the UK National Health Service (NHS). I
leads the NRLS / LFPSE analysis team at NHS Improvement, focussing on
analysing incident reporting data and other NHS data sources to learn
and improve patient safety. I have experience in public health, clinical
networks, acute trust informatics, and leading the establishment of the
data science team at Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED), a national NHS
analytics service from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation
Trust.

I completed my PhD in applied statistics and machine learning at UCL in
2020, focussing on methods for analysing incident reporting data in the
NHS, including multi-level regression models, Generalized Additive
Models, dealing with overdispersion, tree and random forest methods and
natural language processing (NLP). I have a background in training prior
to joining the NHS, and this interest continues now.

I’m particularly into `R`, but skilled in SQL and several other
languages. Bit of a Python n00b, but I’m getting there. I’m into
teaching R and coding skills, statistical skills/reasoning and
techniques and helping others reach their potential. Always happy to
answer questions and point people towards things that I find useful.
